## Overview

**Following the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) scientific method, this app aims to cut on the time spent reading on your computer.** 

![](images/fast-reader.gif)

In the era of small screens, traditional reading (i.e. left-to-right, top-to-bottom) is called into question and the RSVP represents one of the main alternatives. RSVP consists of displaying in sequential order one or more words at a time, thus minimizing saccades and eye blinks. 

The app is fully controllable, with buttons and [keyboard shortcuts](#shortcuts), giving the user the freedom to read at his own pace.
